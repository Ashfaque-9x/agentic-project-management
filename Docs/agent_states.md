# Agent States: Goals and Objectives Resolver (Week 1)
## Objective
A critical initial problem in project management is unclear goals and objectives, affecting 37% of failed projects. Without defining specific, measurable, and agreed-upon goals (SMART goals) at the outset, teams face wasted effort, lack of direction, and poor stakeholder engagement, leading to missed deadlines and scope creep. 
## Example of Unclear Goals:
**Scenario:** A company launches a project to "Improve the website."
**Initial Problem:** The goal is vague. Marketing thinks it means better SEO, design thinks it means a new color scheme, and developers think it means faster load times.
**Consequence:** The team wastes time building the wrong features, resulting in a delayed launch, overspent budget, and stakeholder dissatisfaction. 

## Other common initial problems include:
**Scope Creep:** Uncontrolled addition of requirements without adjusting budget or timeline.
**Poorly Defined Stakeholder Roles:** Involving stakeholders too late, leading to major revisions.
**Unrealistic Deadlines/Budget:** Setting impossible targets from the start.
